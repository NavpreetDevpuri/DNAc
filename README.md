# DNAc
DNAc is a programming language for DNAs.

## DNAc's compiler
We need to develop a compiler that can convert code written in DNAc language into DNA sequence. Observing those DNA sequences and generalizing those can open possibilities to make totally custom plants by just combining those traits.<br>
This is possible by following
 1. Studying DNAs sequences
    1. How DNA sequences work ? 
    2. How those sequences come up to form a trait ?
 2. Collecting different-different traits and corresponding DNA sequences
    1. Some sequence may work like if-else for some quantities.
    2. Some sequence may only responsible for some specific traits like color.
 3. Testing different-different sequences of DNA for finding their traits or work.
    1. We can develop a machine that can automate that process by making and growing different-different versions of a plant having different-different DNA sequences automatically.
